## 👩‍⚕️ About Me
I am a Biomedical Informatics professional focused on building real-world digital health, clinical research, and data engineering tools. My work blends:

- Python + data science  
- Clinical standards (FHIR, CDASH, LOINC, SNOMED)  
- EHR data processing  
- Machine learning for clinical prediction  
- Digital health app design  
- Healthcare workflow automation  

I’m currently developing tools that automate mapping between EHR data and clinical research standards, build patient-tracking dashboards, and convert clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR resources.
