# Hi, I'm Soumya 👋

**Healthcare Data Analyst · MS Biomedical Informatics @ University of Utah**

I work at the intersection of clinical data and analytics — using Python, SQL, and BI tools to clean, validate, and analyze EHR and clinical trial data. I care about data quality, interoperability (FHIR/HL7/CDASH/LOINC), and building audit-ready, reproducible workflows that support real clinical decisions.

## 🔭 What I'm focused on

- Automating **EHR → CRF** and improving data interoperability using **CDASH, LOINC, FHIR**
- Building **predictive models** (logistic regression, ML, NLP) on real-world clinical data
- Creating **dashboards and reports** that are audit-ready and actionable

## 🧪 Featured Projects (repos coming below)

### 1. FHIR-Based Allergy Documentation System
Standardized allergy records using a Python/SQL/FHIR-based module to reduce data entry errors and increase completeness.

### 2. TBI Risk Prediction Using NLP
Logistic regression model (~82% accuracy) on 1,200+ radiology notes + structured ED data to support triage decisions.

### 3. Chronic Disease Self-Management App (Diabetes)
Python-based app for tracking glucose, medications, and lifestyle factors to support adherence and patient engagement.

### 4. EHR → CRF Mapping Demo (Oncology)
Python automation pipeline that maps EHR fields to CRFs, applies **CDASH/LOINC**, and validates mapping for audit readiness.
